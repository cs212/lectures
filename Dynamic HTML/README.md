Dynamic HTML
=================================================

These demos illustrate some basics on dynamic HTML using servlets. 

*Note that these examples are designed to illustrate specific concepts, and may not be an example of proper class design outside of this context.*

To add [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) as a user library in Eclipse, you will need the aggregate `jar` files located at the following links:

- [`jetty-all-9.x.x.jar`](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/)
- [`javax.servlet-3.x.x.jar`](http://central.maven.org/maven2/javax/servlet/javax.servlet-api/)

Replace each `x` with the latest stable version numbers. For help with embedded Jetty, see:

- [Jetty Development Guide - Embedding](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/advanced-embedding.html)

I also recommend you consider the [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) library, which has several useful utilities. 

- [`commons-lang3-v.v.jar](http://commons.apache.org/lang/download_lang.cgi)
